## Completeness

Completenss in predicate logic is a property of a logical system or proof procedure that says that every logically valid formula proveable in the system. A logically valid formula is one that is True in all interpretations.

The completness theorm for predicate logic states that any logically valid formula can be derived using the standard rules of inference in predicate logic. This mean that the system of predicate logic is complete in the sense that it can prove all true statements.

for eg. "all cates are mammals." this sentence is true in predicate logic but incomplete because we don't know what is the mean by maamal.

**Complete deductive Systems for predicate logic**
* Natural deduction
* Gentzen's sequent calculus
* Hilbert's axiom system

**Completenss in predicate can categorized in two types**

1. Sementic completness
Sementic completness deals with the realtionship between logic and models, ensuring that the logic captures all valid statements in terms of meaning or interpretation.

2. Syntactic completness
Syntactic completness focuses on the formal proof system within the logic, ensures that every statements can be derived through formal deductive system.
