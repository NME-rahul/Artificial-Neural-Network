### Features of an expert system

1. Knwoledge Base
2. Inference Engine
3. Knwoledge Acquisiion
4. User interface: Expert system provide user-firndly interface for interacting with the system. Users can input data, ask questions and receive explanations and recommendations in a way that is easy to understand.
5. Explanation Facility: An essential feature of expert system is their ability to explain their reasning. When the system provides a recommendation or make a decision, it can explain why it reached that conclusion, users understand the logic behind it.
6. Inference Mechanism: Expert system employ various inference mechanism to derive conclusions from the available knowledge. These mechanism may include forward chainning(data-driven), backward chainning(goal-driven) or a combination of both.
7. Uncetatnity handling: Expert syatem can handle uncertanity in the knwoledge and data they work with. This includes dealing with incomplete information, conflicting evidence, and probabilistic reasoning.
8. Domain Specificty Expert system are designed for specific problem areas. they excel in domain where there is a well-defined body of expertise and rules.
9. Scalabilty
10. Maintenance and updates
11. Conssitency
12. Adaptability
13. Integration
14. Cost saving
15. Wide applicability

### Characteristics of an Expert system
* Human experts are reishable, but a expert system is permanent
* It helps to distribute the expertise of a human.
* One expert system may contain knwoledge from more then one human expert thus making the solutions more efficient.
* It decreas the cost of consulting and expert for various domains such as medical diagnosis.
* They use a knwoledge base and inference engine.
* Expert system can solve complex problems by deducing new facts through existing facts of knwoledge, represented mostly as if-then rules rather then through.
* Expert system were among the first truly succesful forms of Atirficial intelligence software.
