# RNN

An RNN can be seen as multiple interconnceted neural netowrk. Where in each network a node takes input from it's precedding node(same netowrk) as well as from it's precedding network's node at same level.

RNN are used where a value in data is dependent on it's precedding value, or we can say a time series data(generally)
